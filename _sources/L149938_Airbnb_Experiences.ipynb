These are handcrafted activities designed and led by expert hosts that offer a unique taste of the local scene and culture. Each experience is vetted for quality by a team of editors before it makes its way onto the platform. As the number of Experiences grew, Search & Discoverability, as well as Personalization, have become very important factors for the growth and success of the marketplace. But when Airbnb started the Experiences offering, they were not sure how to rank them.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Labels\n",
        "\n",
        "When labeling training data, Airbnb was mainly interested in two labels: experiences that were booked (which were treated as positive labels) and experiences that were clicked but not booked (which were treated as negative labels). In this manner, Airbnb collected a training dataset of 50,000 examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Features\n",
        "\n",
        "They decided to rank solely based on *Experience Features.* In total they built 25 features, some of which were:\n",

        "- **Experience duration** (e.g. 1h, 2h, 3h, etc.)\n",
        "- **Price** and **Price-per-hour**\n",
        "- **Category** (e.g. cooking class, music, surfing, etc.)\n",
        "- **Reviews** (rating, number of reviews)\n",
        "- **Number of bookings** (last 7 days, last 30 days)\n",
        "- **Occupancy of past and future instances** (e.g. 60%)\n",
        "- **Maximum number of seats** (e.g. max 5 people can attend)\n",

        "### Training\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the training data, labels, and features, Airbnb used the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) model. At this point, they treated the problem as binary classification with a log-loss loss function.\n",

        "\n",
        "Since offline testing often has too many assumptions, e.g. in Airbnb's case it was limited to re-ranking what users clicked and not the entire inventory, they conducted an online experiment, i.e. A/B test, as the next step. They compared the Stage 1 ML model to the rule-based random ranking in terms of the number of bookings. The results were very encouraging as they were able to improve bookings by +13% with the Stage 1 ML ranking model.\n",

        "### MLOps\n",
        "\n",
        "The entire ranking pipeline, including training and scoring, was implemented offline and ran daily in Airflow. The output was just a complete ordering of all Experiences, i.e. an ordered list, which was uploaded to production machines and used every time a search was conducted to rank a subset of Experiences that satisfied the search criteria.\n",

In addition, all query parameters (number of guests, dates, location, etc.) served only as filters for retrieval (e.g. fetch Paris Experiences available next week for 2 guests), and the ranking of Experiences did not change based on those inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two randomly chosen Experiences are likely to be very different, e.g. a Cooking Class vs. a Surf Lesson. At the same time, guests may have different interests and ideas of what they want to do on their trip, and it is our goal to capture that interest fast and serve the right content higher in search results. So, the next step was to add the Personalization capability to the ML ranking model.\n",

Data shows that users like convenience, i.e. large fraction of booked Airbnb Experiences are near booked Airbnb Home.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Experience available during Booked Trip.** Given Home check-in and check-out dates, we have an idea on which dates the guest is looking to book Experiences and can mark Experiences as available or not during those dates.\n",

        "\n",
        "The plots confirmed that features behavior matches what we intuitively expected the model will learn, i.e. Experiences that are closer to Booked Home will rank higher (have higher scores), and Experiences that are available for Booked Trip dates will rank higher (which is very convenient because even in dateless search we can leverage trip dates).\n",

        "### Features based on clickstream data\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Category Intensity:** Weighted sum of user clicks on Experiences that have that particular category, where the sum is over the last 15 days (d_0 to d_now) and A is the number of actions (in this case clicks) on certain category on day d.\n",

        "\n",
        "As search traffic contains searches by both logged-in and logged-out users, Airbnb found it more appropriate to train two models, one with personalization features for logged-in users and one without personalization features that will serve log-out traffic. The main reason was that the logged-in model trained with personalization features relies too much on the presence of those features, and as such is not appropriate for usage on logged-out traffic.\n",

Because of the high cost involved with pre-computing personalized rankings for all users (O(NM), where N is the number of users and M is the number of Experiences), they limited N to only 1 million most active users.\n",
        "- The personalization features at this point were computed only daily, which means that they have up to one day latency (also a factor that can be greatly improved with more investment in infrastructure).\n",
        "\n",

        "- we can use the entered location, such as city, neighborhood, or place of interest, to compute Distance between Experience and Entered Location. This feature helps us rank those Experiences closer to entered location higher.\n",
        "- we can use the entered number of guests (singles, couple, large group) to calculate how it relates to the number of guests in an average booking of Experience that needs to be ranked. This feature helps us rank better fit Experiences higher.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the online setting, Airbnb was also able to leverage the user’s browser language setting to do language personalization on the fly. Below is an example of Stage 3 ML model ranking Experiences offered in Russian higher when browser language is Russian.\n",

        "Finally, in the online setting we also know the Country which the user is searching from. We can use the country information to personalize the Experience ranking based on Categories preferred by users from those countries.

        "### Training\n",
        "\n",
        "To train the model with *Query Features* Airbnb first added them to their historical training data. The inventory at that moment was 16,000 Experiences and they had more than 2 million labeled examples to be used in training with a total of 90 ranking features. As mentioned before, they trained two GBDT models:\n",

        "\n",
        "The advantage of having an online scoring infrastructure is that we can use logged-in model for far more uses than before, because there is no need to pre-compute personalized rankings as we did in Stage 2. Airbnb used the logged-in model whenever personalization signals were available for a particular user id, else the model fall back to using logged-out model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Online evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Airbnb conducted an A/B test to compare the Stage 3 models to Stage 2 models. Once again, they were able to grow the bookings, this time by +5.1%.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "To implement online scoring of thousands of listings in real time, Airbnb have built their own ML infra in the context of their search service. There are mainly three parts of the infrastructure, 1) getting model input from various places in real time, 2) model deployment to production, and 3) model scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model requires three types of signals to conduct scoring: Experience Features, Query Features, and User Features. Different signals were stored differently depending on their size, update frequency, etc. Specifically, due to their large size (hundreds of millions of user keys), the User Features were stored in an online key-value store and search server boxes can look them up when a user does the search. The Experience Features are on the other hand not that large (tens of thousands of Experiences), and as such can be stored in memory of the search server boxes and read directly from there. Finally, the Query Features are not stored at all, and they are just read as they come in from the front end.\n",
        "\n",
        "Experience and User Features are both updated daily as the Airflow pipeline feature generation job finishes. Airbnb is also working on transitioning some of the features to the online world, by using a key-value store that has both read and write capabilities which would allow them to update the features instantly as more data comes in (e.g. new experience reviews, new user clicks, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the model deployment process, they transform the GBDT model file, which originally came from their training pipeline in JSON format, to an internal Java GBDT structure, and load it within the search service application when it starts.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the scoring stage, they first pull in all the features (User, Experience, and Query Features) from their respective locations and concatenate them in a vector used as input to the model. Next, depending on if User Features are empty or not they decide which model to use, i.e. logged-out or logged-in model, respectively. Finally, they return the model scores for all Experiences and rank them on the page in descending order of the scores.\n",

        "Duration: 5\n",
        "\n",
        "Up to this point the ranking model’s objective was to grow bookings. However, a marketplace such as Airbnb Experiences may have several other secondary objectives, as we call them Business Rules, that can be achieved through machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "One such important Business Rule is to Promote Quality. From the beginning they believed that if guests have a really good experience they will come back and book Experiences again in the near future. For that reason, they started collecting feedback from users in terms of 1) star ratings, ranging from 1 to 5, and 2) additional structured multiple-response feedback on whether the Experience was unique, better than expected, engaging, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "As more and more data became available to support their rebooking hypothesis, the trend became more clear. As it can be observed on the left in the figure below, guests who have had a great experience (leave a 5-star rating) are 1.5x more likely to rebook another Experience in the next 90 days compared to guests who have had a less good time (leave 4 star rating or lower).\n",
        "\n",
        "<p><center><img src='_images/L149938_8.png'></center></p>\n",
        "\n",
        "This motivated them to experiment with their objective function, where they changed their binary classification (+1 = booked, -1 = click & not booked) to introduce weights in training data for different quality tiers (e.g. highest for very high quality bookings, lowest for very low quality bookings). The quality tiers were defined by their Quality Team via data analysis. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- *very high quality* Experience is one with >50 reviews, >4.95 review rating and >55% guests saying the Experience was *unique* and *better than expected.*\n",

        "\n",
        "When testing the model trained in such a way the A/B test results (on the right in the figure above) showed that they can leverage machine learning ranking to get more of v*ery high quality* bookings and less of v*ery low quality bookings*, while keeping the overall bookings neutral.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a similar way, they successfully tackled several other secondary objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Discovering and promoting potential *new* *hits* early** using cold-start signals and promoting them in ranking (this led to **+14% booking gain for *new hits*** and **neutral overall bookings)\n",
        "- **Enforcing diversity** in the **top 8 results** such that they can show the diverse set of categories, which is especially important for low-intent traffic (this led to **+2.3% overall booking gain**).\n",
        "- **Optimize Search without Location for Clickability** For *Low Intent* users that land on their webpage but do not search with specified location they think a different objective should be used. Their first attempt was to choose the *Top 18* from *all locations* based on their ranking model scores and then **re-rank** based on **Click-through-rate** (this led to **+2.2% overall booking gain** compared to scenario where they do not re-rank based on CTR).\n",

        "\n",
        "To build out this capability they used [Apache Superset](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/) and [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) to create two dashboards:\n",

In addition, the host lowered the price, which may also have lead to the improvement of ranking.\\\n",

All these factors combined lead to the ranking decline.\n",

        "For example, the left plot shows that Experiences with >50 reviews rank much better than experiences with 10–30 reviews. Looking at the other two plots we can see that on average Experiences with review rating of >4.9 rank the best (much better than ones with lower average rating) and that Experiences for which >55% users say their experience was unique rank much better than non-unique Experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "This type of dashboard is useful for making business decisions and modifications to the ranking algorithm to enforce better behaviors. For example, based on the figure that shows ranking trends of different price range groups (shown below) they noticed that very low price Experiences have too big of an advantage in ranking. They decided to try to reduce that advantage by removing price as one of the signals used by the ranking model.\n",

        "The result of removing the price and retraining the model was that the difference in ranking reduced (after July 1st), without hurting overall bookings. This demonstrates the usefulness of reporting and how ranking can be manipulated using machine learning to achieve desired ranking behavior.\n",

        "- **Loss function** (e.g. by using pairwise loss, where they compare booked Experience with Experience that was ranked higher but not booked, a setup that is far more appropriate for ranking)\n",
        "- **Training labels** (e.g. by using utilities instead of binary labels, i.e. assigning different values to different user actions, such as: 0 for impression, 0.1 for click, 0.2 for click with selected date & time, 1.0 for booking, 1.2 for high quality booking)\n",
        "- **Adding more real-time signals** (e.g. being able to personalize based on immediate user activities, i.e. clicks that happened 10 minutes ago instead of 1 day ago)\n",
        "- **Explicitly asking users about types of activities they wish to do on their trip** (so they can personalize based on declared interest in addition to inferred ones)\n",
        "- **Tackling position bias** that is present in the data they use in training\n",
        "- **Optimizing for additional secondary objectives**, such as helping hosts who host less often than others (e.g. 1–2 a month) and hosts who go on vacation and come back\n",
        "- **Testing different models** beyond GBDT\n",
        "- **Finding more types of supply that work well in certain markets** by leveraging predictions of the ranking model.\n",
        "- **Explore/Exploit framework**\n",
        "- **Test human-in-the-loop approach** (e.g. Staff picks)\n",
