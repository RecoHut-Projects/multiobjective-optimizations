<h1>Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-objective-hyperparameter-optimization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In practice, we may often optimize a machine learning algorithm for a single objective, but we rarely truly care about just one thing. Would we want a 99.99% accurate classifier if it took a week to make each prediction? Possibly, but it represents a very particular scenario. This is a little hyperbolic, but the essential point is true: we must always make tradeoffs between characteristics of algorithmic performance. While traditional characteristics include predictive performance metrics, there are often physical or ethical constraints that an ML algorithm must meet. Netflix famously ran a competition to find the best recommendation algorithm, but <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/">Netflix Never Used Its $1 Million Algorithm Due To Engineering Costs</a>. Just as we may trade off precision and recall by changing the classification threshold, we can navigate the larger tradeoff space (predictive, physical, ethical) of a complete ML pipeline by optimizing the hyperparameters of the system. “Engineering cost,” as in the Netflix example, would be extremely tricky to encode, but prediction latency, serialized model size, and technical measures of fairness, for instance, are all fair game.</p>
<p>We can frame the multi-objective optimization problem as a search for optimal tradeoffs. Let’s imagine that we really care about exactly two objectives: predictive accuracy, and the speed at which we can make a prediction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these things are likely to be in tension. It may be possible to construct a very accurate classifier by using extremely large models, or stacking several ML algorithms, or by performing many complex feature transformations. All of these things increase the computation necessary to make a prediction, and thus slow us down.</p>
<p>Imagine we randomly sampled hyperparameter configurations and measured the speed and accuracy of the resulting models. We would surely find some configurations that result in algorithms being both slower and less accurate than others. Speaking technically, if one point—call it <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code>—is better than another point—<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code>—in one dimension, and at least as good in all other dimensions, we say <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code> <em>dominates</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code>. We’d never want to deploy dominated models, since there are other models that are strictly better in both the optimization objectives.</p>
<p><center><figure><img src='_images/L556513_1.png'><figcaption>As we try different hyperparameter configurations, we’ll find that the resultant models represent different accuracy-speed trade offs. We can visualize each model as a point in the trade off space.</figcaption></figure></center></p>
<p>It’s possible we’d find one point that maximizes both the accuracy and speed of our predictions. In practice, this is unlikely. We might improve accuracy by using deeper trees in a random forest, but deeper trees also take longer to evaluate, so we have traded off some speed for accuracy.</p>
<p>Eventually, we’ll discern an edge in the accuracy-speed tradeoff space, where we cannot find a hyperparameter combination that leads to an improvement in one direction without a negative impact on the other. This edge is called the <em>Pareto frontier</em>, and allows us to make a quantitative tradeoff between our optimization objectives. The Pareto frontier is constructed from the set of non-dominated points, and choosing any one of them gives us our exact accuracy/speed tradeoff.</p>
<p><center><figure><img src='_images/L556513_2.png'><figcaption>The Pareto frontier is formed by those points that are not dominated by any others.</figcaption></figure></center></p>
<p>Ultimately, a deployed ML system will be trained with a single hyperparameter combination, and we must choose a single <em>point</em> in the accuracy-speed plane. The Pareto frontier allows us to present a decision maker with a host of models, some maximizing accuracy, others maximizing speed, and the entire spectrum in between.</p>
<p>How do we find this frontier? We could construct it with a dense random sampling of the hyperparameter search space. This risks being inefficient. We’d like to spend as little time as possible sampling configurations that aren’t likely to expand the Pareto frontier. Every sample on the frontier is useful, because they let us trade off accuracy and speed in a new combination. Samples inside the frontier end up being useless.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-objective Bayesian optimization</strong> is a powerful technique (encompassing a collection of methods) for discovering the Pareto frontier. Rather than diving in at the deep end, let’s first review how Bayesian optimization works for a single objective. We’ll then build on that approach for the multi-objective case and discuss a few specific methods that we experimented with.</p>
<p>The “Bayes” in Bayesian optimization refers to updating our prior beliefs about how the input hyperparameters map to the output objectives, resulting in a better, posterior belief about the mapping. This approach to optimization is fundamentally sequential, and each iteration of the sequence follows the same procedure. The procedure looks like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We have an unknown function between hyperparameters and our objective. We don’t know this true function (we’ll call it the <strong>objective function</strong>), but we can sample points from it by training a ML algorithm and evaluating the objective (calculating the accuracy, for instance). This is computationally expensive, so we’d like to do it as little as possible. Our goal is to optimize the output of this function, by which we mean to find it’s highest (or lowest, if appropriate) value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><center><img src='_images/L556513_3.png'></center></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Because we don’t know the true function, we fit a probabilistic <strong>surrogate function</strong>—usually a Gaussian Process (a class of flexible, non-parametric functions (technically, a <em>stochastic process</em>, which is a <em>space</em> of functions))—to some random samples from the objective function. It’s important that this surrogate function captures uncertainty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><center><img src='_images/L556513_4.png'></center></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>From the surrogate function, we derive an <strong>acquisition function</strong> (if you’re counting, that’s the third function we’ve just introduced). The acquisition function tells us where in hyperparameter space to sample next. For instance, we might choose the point that has the highest probability of improving (PoI) the objective. Or, we might choose the point with the highest expected improvement (EI), which is different from PoI!</p></li>
<li><p>Optimizing the acquisition function, for instance finding the highest EI, is itself an optimization problem! Fortunately, our surrogate function is very quick to evaluate compared to training a whole ML model, so we can find the highest EI point with iterative optimization methods. This inner loop of optimization is very fast.</p></li>
<li><p>The optimal points of the acquisition function tell us where to sample next, so we evaluate our <strong>objective function</strong> at those hyperparameters and update our <strong>surrogate function</strong> with the output (making it a better model of the unknown, true objective function). Hence <em>Bayesian</em> optimization: we have a prior belief (the surrogate function) about the objective function, and we update that belief as we sample more points.</p></li>
<li><p>We repeat this loop of updating the surrogate, calculating a new proposal point to sample, and evaluating the objective function. Eventually, we find an output of the objective function we’re happy with, or else blow our compute budget, and stop!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a lot of functions. In a nutshell, we’re modeling the relationship between hyperparameters and objectives, and using that model to make better hyperparameter choices.</p>
<p>“Better” is doing some work there. When selecting a next datapoint to sample, we must make a tradeoff between maximizing the objective function as much as possible with the information that we have, and learning more about the objective function so we can make better future decisions. This is known as the explore-exploit tradeoff, and we navigate it by choosing an acquisition function. Each possible acquisition function determines the degree to which we explore and exploit the surrogate function. Some acquisition functions favour exploration of unsampled regions, others favour exploitation, and most have their own parameters to control the degree of exploration. A nice <em>exploration</em> of some acquisition functions is given in the Distill.pub article <a class="reference external" href="https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/">Exploring Bayesian Optimization</a> (which is also a very accessible introduction to Bayesian optimization generally). If you’re unfamiliar with Gaussian Processes, we recommend first reading <a class="reference external" href="https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/">A Visual Exploration of Gaussian Processes</a>.</p>
<p>We can overfit hyperparameters just as we can overfit parameters. When performing such a search, it’s a good idea to hold out an additional dataset for comparing models. This is true even with grid search. With grid or random search, we don’t explicitly “learn” a function, we just take a finite number of samples from it, but we might nonetheless pick a combination that is very good for the training set, and not so much for the test set. We can counter this by withholding an evaluation dataset split before starting any hyperparameter optimization, and using that dataset only for reporting our final metrics, not for choosing a model or finding the Pareto frontier.</p>
<p>Since we now have a recipe for single-objective optimization, there’s an obvious solution to multi-objective optimization: we may reduce multi-objective optimization to a single objective case. We could do this by optimizing for a weighted combination of the two (or more) objectives, reducing them to a single number—a <em>scalar</em>—that we want to maximize or minimize. This is known as <em><strong>scalarization</strong></em>. Then, we can apply regular 1-dimensional optimization, and forget about there ever having been more than one objective.</p>
<p>This approach is only really viable if we have strong a priori quantitative knowledge about how much we care about each objective, since we must construct the precise combination to maximize. For instance, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">speed</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">accuracy</span></code>, if we care about accuracy twice as much as speed. One reason this is hard is that the shape of the tradeoff is rarely known in advance. Are we prepared to sacrifice 10 points of accuracy for a 10 millisecond improvement in speed? How about 3 points of accuracy for a 100ms improvement? It is unlikely that we could confidently make these decisions without knowing what tradeoffs are available.</p>
<p>Maximizing a scalarized objective is going to hone in on a single point in the objective space (the speed-accuracy plane, for example). This is exactly one point on the Pareto frontier! So one way of discovering the Pareto frontier is by first optimizing for one point, then changing the weights in the scalarization, and repeating the procedure, each time optimizing for a different combination of accuracy and speed. Randomizing this combination is known, unsurprisingly, as <em><strong>random scalarization</strong></em>, and it forms the basis of the multi-objective optimization algorithm known as <a class="reference external" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1583627"><strong>ParEGO</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It turns out it is possible to attack a multi-objective problem directly, without scalarizing, with a cleverly constructed acquisition function: the <strong>Expected Hypervolume Improvement</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pareto frontier generalizes the notion of optimizing to more than one dimension. But one can’t “maximize the frontier” – what does that even mean? To maximize (or minimize) a thing, we must have a notion of comparison between its possible values. For a single dimension, we compare magnitudes. How then, can we generalize comparison to multiple dimensions? By comparing volumes! Enter the Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function. It’s perhaps best understood with a walkthrough.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a Pareto frontier of points initialized by randomly sampling the hyperparameter space. Even though these hyperparameter configurations were sampled randomly, we can still draw a Pareto frontier, which is just the set of points that are not dominated by others. We additionally choose a reference point that is completely dominated by the entire Pareto frontier (by every point on it). The hypervolume of interest is the volume occupied between the reference point and the Pareto frontier. With 2 objectives, the hypervolume is just the area. We are looking for points that increase this volume, which, intuitively, are points that push the Pareto frontier out, away from the reference point.</p>
<p><center><figure><img src='_images/L556513_5.png'><figcaption>The green shaded region is the hypervolume between the points on the Pareto frontier and the reference point, in this case, at the origin of the chart.</figcaption></figure></center></p>
<p>When we draw a new point, we sample from the <em>hyperparameter</em> space, but we want a volume improvement in the <em>objective space</em>. Our surrogate model – usually consisting of an independent Gaussian Process model for each objective – is approximating how input hyperparameters will result in output objective values, and the goal is to choose input hyperparameters that maximize the expected hypervolume improvement in the output space.</p>
<p>Choosing points that maximize the expected hypervolume improvement is itself an optimization problem, just like finding those that maximize expected improvement or probability of improvement in the single-objective case. We can perform this optimization using our surrogate functions, which are fast to compute. If we knew the objective function perfectly, the hypervolume improvement from adding a new point might look something like this.</p>
<p><center><figure><img src='_images/L556513_6.png'><figcaption>The red shaded region is the hypervolume improvement that would result from adding the new candidate point.</figcaption></figure></center></p>
<p>However, we don’t know that objective function perfectly—we’re modelling it with surrogate functions (one for each objective). The surrogate functions come with uncertainty attached, since they’re just our best approximation of the objective function. Because of that uncertainty, we can’t be sure exactly where on the accuracy-speed space a given hyperparameter combination will land us, so the picture looks a little more like this.</p>
<p><center><figure><img src='_images/L556513_7.png'><figcaption>In reality, we don’t know the objective function perfectly—we are modeling it with a surrogate function that has uncertainty. The fuzzy point and area on the chart indicate that the exact location of the point, and thus the associated hypervolume improvement, are uncertain.</figcaption></figure></center></p>
<p>This uncertainty is the reason we compute the <em>Expected</em> HVI, which means integrating over the uncertainty. There are fast computational methods for doing so using Monte Carlo and discretizing the space. Fortunately, evaluating the EHVI is not nearly as expensive as training an ML model and finding the true hypervolume improvement. So we can find the point that maximizes the EHVI using iterative methods (think <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno_algorithm">BFGS</a>). This is made all the faster by having exact gradients of the MC estimate of the EHVI, thanks to modern auto-differentiation tools.<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2021/07/07/exploring-multi-objective-hyperparameter-optimization.html#fn:5">5</a></p>
<p>We evaluate the objective function at the suggested hyperparameters, and update our surrogate models. We can repeat this process for as long as our compute budget allows. By maximizing the hypervolume between the reference point (origin) and the Pareto frontier, we effectively construct the frontier itself!</p>
<p>There are two notable enhancements to expected hypervolume improvement. The first, qEHVI, allows for parallel suggested points. The second, MOTPE, replaces the GP models of the objectives with tree-structured Parzen estimators.</p>

<h2>qEHVI<a class="headerlink" href="#qehvi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>That little “q” signifies a recent advance – trying multiple new points in parallel – introduced in <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05078">Differentiable Expected Hypervolume Improvement for Parallel Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization</a>, which also introduced the exact MC gradients mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>We need not restrict ourselves to trying only one new hyperparameter config at a time. The “q” in qEHVI indicates the number of parallel candidates suggested. The q candidates are selected by optimizing the <em>total</em> hypervolume improvement from their <em>combined</em> contribution, so they ought to work together. This makes sense, for if we chose three points that each maximize the EHVI independently, they’d be at the same spot. It’s a clever mechanism for exploiting parallelism in an otherwise sequential optimization process.</p>

<p>The full technical treatment of qEHVI is given in the paper. We warn the intrepid reader that for anyone unfamiliar with Bayesian Optimization literature (which is vast and deep), and through no fault of the authors, the paper is a tough read. We recommend starting with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNt_hBjH4wU">this short video</a> explaining the contributions of the paper.</p>

<h2>Multi-Objective Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (MOTPE)<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-objective-tree-structured-parzen-estimators-motpe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>qEHVI improved on the EHVI acquisition function. An alternative approach is to improve upon the surrogate functions from which EHVI is calculated.</p>
<p>Gaussian processes offer a flexible approach to modeling which captures feature interactions. However, they are continuous in nature, and can struggle with awkward search spaces involving discrete transitions. An alternative approach known as Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) is superior for these spaces, and hyperparameter optimization often involves just such spaces. For example, the hyperparameter specifying the number of neurons in the third layer of a neural network is irrelevant if the hyperparameter specifying the number of layers is less than three in a given trial. GPs <em>can</em> model such functions with a continuous approximation, but the search space fundamentally is tree shaped.</p>
<p>Whereas GPs seek to model the probability of a given output (accuracy, for instance) conditional on the input hyperparameters <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p(\text{accuracy}|n\_layers,learning\_rate,\dots)\)</span>, TPEs turn this around and model the conditional distribution of hyperparameters given the output:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}p\left(\text{hyperparameter} \ |\ \text{objective}\right) \ = \begin{cases} l &amp; \mathrm{if} \ \text{objective} \ &gt;\ \text{threshold}\\ g &amp; \mathrm{if} \ \text{objective} \ &lt; \ \text{threshold} \end{cases}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The two functions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span> are themselves density estimations (“Parzen estimator” is just a particular name for a kernel density estimator), and functions of the hyperparameters. The threshold between them selects for whether the objective is among the best values, where “best” is defined as some upper quantile. A different density is fit to those good (upper quantile) objective values (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l\)</span>) and the poorer (lower quantiles) ones (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span>). New hyperparameters are drawn such that they’re very likely under the distribution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l\)</span>, and unlikely under the distribution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span>.</p>
<p><center><figure><img src='_images/L556513_9.png'><figcaption>TPE fits two densities to each hyperparameter, then samples hyperparameters from the configuration, l, that is fit only to the better objective values. In reality, the distributions may not separate so neatly.</figcaption></figure></center></p>
<p>Modeling the conditional distribution of each hyperparameter, rather than the objectives, means we can handle tree-shaped hyperparameter configurations such as the neural net example above. We simply don’t update the model, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p(hyperparameter|objective)\)</span>, for a hyperparameter if it wasn’t used in a particular trial. As a trade off for this effective handling of tree-shaped search spaces, we lose the ability to model hyperparameter interactions, since each hyperparameter has its own conditional density. Whether this trade-off makes sense depends on the shape of our search space, and alas can rarely be known in advance.</p>
