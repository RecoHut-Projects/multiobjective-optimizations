Pareto efficiency implies that resources are allocated in the most economically efficient manner, but does not imply equality or fairness. An economy is said to be in a Pareto optimum state when no economic changes can make one individual better off without making at least one other individual worse off.\n","\n","<p><center><img src='_images/L839342_1.png'></center></p>\n","\n","## Toy example\n","\n","$$\\min_x (f_1(x), f_2(x),...,f_M(x))$$\n","\n","$min_{x \\in S}(f1, f2)$, where, *decision variable* $x$ is a number, *feasible solution set* $S \\in [0,6]$, f*irst objective* $f_1(x) = 2(𝑥−1) + 1$, and, *second objective* $f_2(x) = 2(x-3)^2 + 1$.\n","\n","<p><center><img src='_images/L839342_2.png'></center></p>\n","\n","In interval of [3, 6], both 𝑓1 and 𝑓2 are increasing.
